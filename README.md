# Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to the Advent of Code 2024 implemented in TypeScript.

Each day's challenge is located in root directory under its respective day folder (e.g., `src/day01`).

To run a specific day's solution, use the following command:

```sh
npx tsx day01/task1.ts
```

Don't forget to `npm install` before running the solutions.

Happy coding!
